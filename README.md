# Web3DB

Welcome! The aim of this repository is to explore use cases and limitations of current Web 3.0 database technologies. This project looks specifically at Textile's Thread DB. In this repository, we attempt to create a client application interfacing with Thread DB and utilizes _all_ its features. We then evaluate the biggest weaknesses of the Thread DB's framework, and attempt to use it's underlying technology to develop solutions for the weaknesses, either by wrapping it in in-house code, or by changing the source code itself.
A project inspecting a similar framework, Orbit DB can be found at [TODO]. Both projects were developed under the supervision of Dr. WenZhan Song at the University of Georgia. 

## This consists of three seperate subprojects:
### - Web3DB: A trustless decentralized database built on top of Thread DB, mimicing Thread DB's API calls, but offering additional support for access control
- Currently in development. 
### - Web3DBAdmin: A serverless web portal living in IPFS that handles the administration of peer-to-peer decentralized databases such as ThreadDB (similar to phpMyAdmin)
- An implementation supporting Thread DB can be found at https://web3dbadmin.on.fleek.co/
- An implementation supporting Web3DB is currently in development

### - TODO: Smart Contract?
